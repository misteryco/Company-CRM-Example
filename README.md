The main idea behind the project is to create an simple operational REST application for companies which allows:

● CRUD operations to manage companies
  Company instance have company name, logo and description.
● CRUD operations to manage company employees
  Employee have first name, last name, date of birth, photo, position, salary and company.

The project consists of main app called 'crm_for_companies'.

The project app uses SQLITE3 as a DBMS.

The app need a working CLOUDINARY account for photo and logo upload and serve.

The project app uses environment variables to hide sensitive information.

DISCLAIMER: This app is not a fully operational product, it's not intended for commercial use and has many features that haven't been properly tested or developed.
